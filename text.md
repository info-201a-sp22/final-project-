### Observed Trends Among Mental Health Disorders and Physical, Social, & Substance-Related Covariates in the United States

#### Website, visualizations, and conclusions written and designed by Sam Sievertsen, Zayna Lughod, Kayla Stocker, and Emily Garat for INFO201, Spring 2022

#### Purpose

Despite major public outreach, research, and education throughout the last two decades in American society, psychiatric and psychological disorders remain disastrously pervasive and pathological. Hence, we propose an analysis of current population rates of the most prevalent clinical disorders: anxiety, depression, and dementia, and an examination of relevant co-variates including opioid use, chronic pain, hypertension, and social functioning. Accordingly, we plan to conduct meta, correlation coefficient, regression, and other analysis measures to be presented in various visualizations. This data is vital in understanding population occurrence rates, significant contributing factors, and corresponding treatments.


#### Introduction

We will be looking at mental health disorders (specifically anxiety, depression, and dementia) and how they relate to other issues such as chronic pain, opioid use, social functioning, and hypertension in the general American public. We chose to research these mental health disorders because of their widespread influence in the U.S. today and it is important to have an understanding of their correlations with other health conditions. We also realize that many mental health disorders are greatly impacted by other factors, so we want to understand the extent and why certain factors might matter more than others. Our research questions include:

-   How frequently do these disorders occur?
-   What is the relationship between the mental health disorders (anxiety, depression, and dementia) and these co-variates?
-   Which of the co-variates relates the most to mental health disorders/which relates the least?
-   How might we improve these disorders?


#### The Data

The following data set originates from the [2020 National Health Interview Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/2020nhis.htm) conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The data was collected via a questionnaire from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and datasets are available for viewing and/or downloading via the Internet. The procedure and methodology in collecting the data were constructed based on The Statistical Design of the Health Household-Interview Survey published by The Public Health and Service Publication. The data was also collected using complex sample design software such as SUDAAN, Stata, SPSS, R, and SAS survey procedures. The goal of collecting this census-based information regularly was to evaluate and monitor the general health and wellbeing of the nation. The data assesses a broad range of health topics and provides the information necessary to establish proper health status, health care access, and advancements toward achieving national health objectives. We think this data is appropriate because it comes from a generally well-regarded source (the CDC) and, despite the large amount of data, seems relatively clean. Our dataset contains 31,568 rows of data and 618 columns of data. 


#### Implications

In addressing our analytic research questions, it appears the relationship between mental health disorders and physical symptoms may be due to the fact that those experiencing chronic pain are also likely to be struggling from a mental health illness, as is sometimes the case with opioid use disorders. Anecdotal evidence suggests social functioning is impacted by mental health, so our analysis aims to learn if there are empirical trends to match these experiences. The possible implications of our following data set are assessing how mental illness can manifest into physical-related symptoms that can affect the overall well-being of peoples' lives. The data that we are accumulating can help policymakers establish more accommodating laws and features for those that suffer from mental health-related illnesses as mental health is just as significant as physical illness and can often both be heavily correlated. This can also establish various innovations towards certain technologies that can support and aid those who struggle with mental health-related illnesses, but our initial goal is to provide the general public with a tool to visualize the challenges many of us face every day. On a personal level, easy-to-read and interpret datasets pertaining to mental health comorbidities will ideally help others to find community and support in their experiences with language and numerical data to help tell their story.

#### Limitations, Challenges, & Ethics

Because of the sheer amount of data contained in the data frame we're using, specific details may get lost when establishing various points. Since we are using variables on mental health that are interpreted through a master list of all health-related aspects in adults, this can potentially make it difficult to instill accurate and precise data as our main data set merely includes mental health as one variable among many. Using co-variates to assess our main topic on mental health may result in disregarding other important data included in the NHIS. These are not necessarily limitations, but rather things to remain mindful of when we are evaluating various forms of the data we are collecting and emphasizing the importance of utilizing it to the best of our ability. As mentioned above, this dataset contains responses from many populations all across the nation and therefore is also lacking in contextual information to expand upon in our visualizations.

An ethicality to keep in mind when evaluating this data is that the accessibility of this questionnaire is derived from the Internet, meaning the population completing the survey is most likely restricted to individuals with prior knowledge of and access to online surveying methods. Associations based on this dataset may be skewed due to differential misclassification, as it is a voluntary survey so those who choose to respond may have a slightly different perspective influenced by a foundational understanding of the survey's purpose. There may be contextual factors contributing to individuals' willingness or unwillingness to respond that could bias the available data.
