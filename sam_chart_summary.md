Mental health disorders 

## Data Visualization ##
This chart demonstrates the national trends in occurrence rates of Clinical anxiety, depressive, and dementia disorders in the US between the years of 2016 and 2020.

## Purpose ##
In utilizing population diagnostic interview data, a prevalence ratio (*occurrence rate*) of **mental health** disorders was established for the last five years of completed data collection by the CDC. Possessing such a rate and being able to describe how it has fluctuated throughout the last five years allows key insights into co morbidity and societal influences on the frequency and pathology of these disorders, thus allowing for exploration of targeted treatment areas and effective treatments.

## Insights ##
* *Anxiety Disorders* and *depressive disorders* coincided at a consistent population rate of **6-8%** between the years of 2016 and 2018, and increased dramatically from 2018 to 2020 with current rates residing at approximately **18%** and **21%**, respectively.
  * This stratification trend may be explained in part by the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, and by societal alterations in sleep, stress, economic status, technology access, etc.   
* *Dementia disorder* data was not available prior to 2018. The population occurrence rate did decrease, however, from 2018 (**3%**) to 2019 (**1.1%**) and 2019 to 2020 (**1%**).
  * This trend is quite surprising, and may reflect advances in preventative healthcare, treatment options, or a lapse in the dataset.
